## 🔑 Key Features
- ✅ Helmet usage detection (helmet worn/not worn)
- ✅ Gas leakage monitoring (MQ sensors)
- ✅ Temperature & humidity tracking
- ✅ Fall detection for worker safety
- ✅ Heart rate monitoring
- ✅ Real-time data with **Firebase Realtime Database**
- ✅ Web dashboard with **React.js** (3D-style, responsive UI)
- ✅ Visual indicators (red/green bulbs) & instant alerts
- ✅ ESP32 microcontroller for IoT connectivity
